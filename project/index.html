<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics, Communication, and Information Engineering at the National College of Engineering. As a student in this multidisciplinary field, I am building a strong foundation in electronic systems, communication technologies, and information processing while continuously exploring how hardware and software intersect in modern engineering solutions. My academic journey has helped me develop analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deep curiosity about emerging technologies that shape today’s digital world.

Alongside my coursework, I enjoy applying theoretical concepts to practical projects, experiments, and self-driven learning. I am particularly interested in areas such as embedded systems, signal processing, networking, and web technologies, where engineering principles meet real-world applications. I believe in learning by doing, and I actively seek opportunities to improve my technical skills through hands-on projects, collaboration, and continuous practice.

I am motivated, adaptable, and eager to grow as an engineer while contributing meaningfully to innovative and impactful solutions. With a strong passion for technology and a commitment to lifelong learning, I aim to build a career that combines engineering knowledge, creativity, and practical problem-solving to address real-world challenges.</p>
